# Morse-Code-Encoder
Simple C++ project I wrote freshman year when I was bored. 
Essentially, instead of outputting keyboard input in the english lexicon,
keystrokes are translated character-by-character into Morse Code in real-time.
It also saves the original text input to an output file (in case you're too 
lazy to re-read what you wrote in Morse Code.)
(I used it for writing silly things like song lyrics to my screen without my neighbors
in class realizing what a dork I was being.)

Note: I wrote this before I learned about data structures like dictionaries, hash-maps, etc.
This could honestly be written much more efficiently using something other than a few dozen
switch statements. Maybe someday I'll rewrite it.

Also side note: A lot of my projects revolve around Morse-Code simply because I learned
it a long time ago and it's just kind of ingrained in my brain now.
